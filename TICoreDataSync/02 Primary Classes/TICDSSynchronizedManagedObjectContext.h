/**  
 Any changes you wish to synchronize for managed objects must take place within a synchronized managed object context.
 
 This class provides access to the `TICDSDocumentSyncManager` to handle synchronization of changes, and also overrides the `save:` method to alert the sync manager either side of calling the super implementation of `save:`. 
 
 In a future version of the framework, the `save:` overridden method will likely be removed in favor of Core Data notifications.
